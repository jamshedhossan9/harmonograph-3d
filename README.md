# Harmonograph 3D
A tool to draw geometric images like Harmonograph but in 3D. A 3d version of my project [Harmonograph](https://jamshedhossan9.github.io/harmonograph/).

> A [harmonograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph) is a mechanical apparatus that employs pendulums to create a geometric image. The drawings created typically are Lissajous curves or related drawings of greater complexity. The devices, which began to appear in the mid-19th century and peaked in popularity in the 1890s, cannot be conclusively attributed to a single person, although Hugh Blackburn, a professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, is commonly believed to be the official inventor.

This project simulates a harmonograph, one of the various types available. To generate drawings, users can specify their own settings. Users can see a few preset samples that are being emulated. Prior to drawing, they have the ability to alter the inputs of preset designs. The browser will cache the last configuration that was used.

The Project is written in **Vu3** and **Typescript**.

Larger screens provide the greatest experience.
