Harmonographs are simple but interesting devices that display some of the complex, mysterious, and beautiful patterns hidden in simple harmonic motion, such as pendulums and spinning wheels. 
        This is a form of harmonograph that operates on the rotation of two wheels and combine the motion to a single point and draws beautiful geometric images in a 3D scene."/>
